# Forms Directory

This directory contains blank PDF forms used by the Claim Cipher Total Loss System.

## Files

### `blank-bcif-form.pdf`
- **Purpose**: Blank Basic Claim Information Form (BCIF) used for total loss claims
- **Source**: CCC Valuation form template
- **Usage**: System loads this form, fills it with extracted CCC estimate data, and generates completed BCIF for TPA submission
- **Fields**: Contains all standard BCIF fields including vehicle information, options, and claim details

## How It Works

1. **Upload CCC Estimate**: User uploads CCC estimate PDF
2. **Data Extraction**: System extracts vehicle and claim data
3. **Form Loading**: System loads `blank-bcif-form.pdf` from this directory  
4. **Field Mapping**: Extracted data is mapped to form field names
5. **Form Filling**: PDF-lib fills the actual form fields with extracted data
6. **PDF Generation**: Completed BCIF is generated as downloadable PDF

## Adding New Forms

To add additional blank forms:
1. Place PDF file in this directory
2. Update PDF service with new form path
3. Add field mapping configuration
4. Test form filling functionality

## Form Field Mapping

The system uses field names from the PDF's form definition (FDF) to map data:
- Text fields: Filled with extracted string values
- Checkboxes: Checked/unchecked based on vehicle options
- Date fields: Formatted date values from CCC estimate
